# Flutter responsive UI

This flutter package allows you to resize font responsively and get to know what kind of device the app is running on.

## Getting Started

To use this package, add `flutter_responsive_ui` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/). 

You can use this package in multiple cases. You can get the type of the device that you're running your application on ! You can find if it's a **mobile**, a **tablet** or a **desktop** ! You can even make the deference between a **small tablet** and a **large tablet** !

You can also make your UI and font size responsive depending on the device you're running the app on. By default, you'll need to develop on a **mobile emulator** because the default scale factor are based on small screens. If you want to directly develop on **tablet or desktop emulators**, feel free to use the ```init``` function to set the scale factors you want.

## Functions
You can easily know on what device you're on using : ```  ```
